# onecore

Welcome to the official and only website of onecore - the one page cms!

## What onecore is

onecore consists of one single file which contains the onecore-source (PHP 5)
and the content of the website, too. Imagine, you have one HTML site - a manual,
a frontpage, a linklist or something like that - and you want to edit this page
without any external editor. Then onecore is perfect for you. Onecore is HTML
page and content in one file.

## Installation

To install onecore, simply copy it to a directory inside your web root and name
it as you want. Make sure that the file extension tells your webserver to
activate PHP. Important is the write permission for PHP respective the webserver
on this file.

## The first launch

Launch onecore (http://yoursite.com/onecoreFileName.extension). In the further
steps I guess that you placed your file under http://localhost/index.php.

Now you see a little HTML-Page with sample content. To open the administration
area, simply go to http://localhost/index.php?admin. I think most of the further
steps are self-explaining.
